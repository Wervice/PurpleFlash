If your chrome home page or new tab page is boring, you can use PurpleFlash to spice it up.

There are two options:

## 1 🏠 As homepage
Select the newtab.html file as home page when you launch chrome under chrome://settings/appearance. Every new chrome window will have purple flash on the first screen.

## 2 🌐 For every new tab
Load the purpleflash folder as unpacked extension under chrome://extensions/. Now every new tab page will look better.
You can also add the 1. option.
